            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Walking through the maze was an eye-opening experience. At first, I was hasty, randomly choosing paths without a clear plan, 
                which led me to many dead-ends. This taught me the importance of having a strategy. I should have started by observing the 
                maze's general layout, perhaps looking for any obvious patterns or areas with fewer branches. Another mistake was not marking 
                the paths I had already taken. This caused me to retrace my steps multiple times, wasting a lot of time. In the future, I will 
                use a simple method like leaving a "trail" to keep track of where I've been. Overall, this maze-walking attempt has made me 
                realize that patience, planning, and organization are crucial in solving complex problems.</p>
