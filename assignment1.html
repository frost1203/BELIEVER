            <h2>Real-time perception and decision-making system</h2>
            <p><strong>Application:</strong><br>1.Environmental Perception: Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors such as cameras, lidars, and radars. Computers quickly process sensor data, like identifying objects from camera images and measuring distances from lidar. They also blend data from multiple sensors, combining camera visuals with lidar distances for better accuracy.
                <br>2.Path Planning: Using sensor data, computers create and store detailed maps with road and traffic info. Based on the vehicle's position and destination, they calculate optimal routes and adjust them according to real-time traffic and obstacles.
                <br>3.Decision-making and Control: Computers decide on speed, steering, etc., considering traffic rules. For example, they determine actions at traffic lights. Then, they send commands to power, steering, and braking systems to control the vehicle.
                <br>4.System Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis: Computers continuously monitor all system components. When a fault occurs, they diagnose it and respond, like switching to a backup sensor or triggering emergency stops.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance:</strong><br>Computers are of paramount importance in autonomous driving. They process sensor data from cameras, lidars, and radars in real - time, enabling the vehicle to perceive the environment accurately. By fusing this data, they enhance perception. For path planning, computers calculate optimal routes and adjust them dynamically. They make crucial driving decisions and control vehicle systems precisely. Moreover, they constantly monitor for faults and take immediate action. Without computers, autonomous driving would be an impossible feat, as they are the core that ensures safe and efficient operation.</p>
